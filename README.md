**Linket Agent — a self-improving AI agent.** Fork of [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) by Nous Research, hosted at [linket.com.br](https://linket.com.br). It's the only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure that costs nearly nothing when idle. It's not tied to your laptop — talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (200+ models), [NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com) (Nemotron), [Xiaomi MiMo](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com), [z.ai/GLM](https://z.ai), [Kimi/Moonshot](https://platform.moonshot.ai), [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), OpenAI, or your own endpoint. Switch with `linket model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

## Quick Install

### Linux, macOS, WSL2, Termux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://linket.com.br/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell) — Early Beta

> **Heads up:** Native Windows support is **early beta**. It installs and runs, but hasn't been road-tested as broadly as our Linux/macOS/WSL2 paths. Please [file issues](https://github.com/robertbr123/Linket-Agent/issues) when you hit rough edges. For the most battle-tested Windows setup today, run the Linux/macOS one-liner above inside **WSL2**.

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://linket.com.br/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer handles everything: uv, Python 3.11, Node.js, ripgrep, ffmpeg, **and a portable Git Bash** (MinGit, unpacked to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\linket\git` — no admin required, completely isolated from any system Git install).  Linket uses this bundled Git Bash to run shell commands.

If you already have Git installed, the installer detects it and uses that instead.  Otherwise a ~45MB MinGit download is all you need — it won't touch or interfere with any system Git.

> **Android / Termux:** The tested manual path is documented in the [Termux guide](https://linket.com.br/docs/getting-started/termux). On Termux, Linket installs a curated `.[termux]` extra because the full `.[all]` extra currently pulls Android-incompatible voice dependencies.
>
> **Windows:** Native Windows is supported as an **early beta** — the PowerShell one-liner above installs everything, but expect rough edges and please file issues when you hit them. If you'd rather use WSL2 (our most battle-tested Windows path), the Linux command works there too. Native Windows install lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\linket`; WSL2 installs under `~/.linket` as on Linux.  The only Linket feature that currently needs WSL2 specifically is the browser-based dashboard chat pane (it uses a POSIX PTY — classic CLI and gateway both run natively).

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
linket              # start chatting!
```

---

## Getting Started

```bash
linket              # Interactive CLI — start a conversation
linket model        # Choose your LLM provider and model
linket tools        # Configure which tools are enabled
linket config set   # Set individual config values
linket gateway      # Start the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
linket setup        # Run the full setup wizard (configures everything at once)
linket claw migrate # Migrate from OpenClaw (if coming from OpenClaw)
linket update       # Update to the latest version
linket doctor       # Diagnose any issues
```

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Linket has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `linket`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action | CLI | Messaging platforms |
|---------|-----|---------------------|
| Start chatting | `linket` | Run `linket gateway setup` + `linket gateway start`, then send the bot a message |
| Start fresh conversation | `/new` or `/reset` | `/new` or `/reset` |
| Change model | `/model [provider:model]` | `/model [provider:model]` |
| Set a personality | `/personality [name]` | `/personality [name]` |
| Retry or undo the last turn | `/retry`, `/undo` | `/retry`, `/undo` |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]` |
| Browse skills | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>` | `/<skill-name>` |
| Interrupt current work | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message | `/stop` or send a new message |
| Platform-specific status | `/platforms` | `/status`, `/sethome` |

For the full command lists, see the [CLI guide](https://linket.com.br/docs/user-guide/cli) and the [Messaging Gateway guide](https://linket.com.br/docs/user-guide/messaging).

## Migrating from OpenClaw

If you're coming from OpenClaw, Linket can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`linket setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
linket claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
linket claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
linket claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
linket claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:
- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.linket/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **Command allowlist** — approval patterns
- **Messaging settings** — platform configs, allowed users, working directory
- **API keys** — allowlisted secrets (Telegram, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs)
- **TTS assets** — workspace audio files
- **Workspace instructions** — AGENTS.md (with `--workspace-target`)

See `linket claw migrate --help` for all options, or use the `openclaw-migration` skill for an interactive agent-guided migration with dry-run previews.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! See the [Contributing Guide](https://linket.com.br/docs/developer-guide/contributing) for development setup, code style, and PR process.

Quick start for contributors — clone and go with `setup-hermes.sh`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertbr123/Linket-Agent.git
cd linket-agent
./setup-hermes.sh     # installs uv, creates venv, installs .[all], symlinks ~/.local/bin/hermes
./linket              # auto-detects the venv, no need to `source` first
```

Manual path (equivalent to the above):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv .venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
scripts/run_tests.sh
```

> **RL Training (optional):** The RL/Atropos integration (`environments/`) — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/robertbr123/Linket-Agent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup) for the full setup.
