# Installation

Get Linket Agent up and running in under two minutes with the one-line installer.

## Quick Install

### Linux / macOS / WSL2

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertbr123/Linket-Agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell) — Early Beta

:::warning Early BETA
Native Windows support is **early beta**. It installs and works for the common paths, but hasn't been road-tested as broadly as our POSIX installers. Please [file issues](https://github.com/robertbr123/Linket-Agent/issues) when you hit rough edges. For the most battle-tested setup on Windows today, use the Linux/macOS one-liner above inside **WSL2** instead.
:::

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertbr123/Linket-Agent/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer handles **everything**: `uv`, Python 3.11, Node.js 22, `ripgrep`, `ffmpeg`, **and a portable Git Bash** (MinGit — a slim, self-contained Git for Windows distribution that Linket uses for shell commands).  It clones the repo under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\linket\linket-agent`, creates a virtualenv, and adds `linket` to your **User PATH**.  Restart your terminal (or open a new PowerShell window) after the install so PATH picks up.

**How Git is handled:**
1. If `git` is already on your PATH, the installer uses your existing install.
2. Otherwise it downloads portable **MinGit** (~45MB, from the official `git-for-windows` GitHub release) and unpacks it to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\linket\git`.  No admin rights required.  Completely isolated — it won't interfere with any system Git install, broken or otherwise.

**Why not use winget?**  Earlier designs auto-installed Git via `winget install Git.Git`, but winget fails badly when a system Git install is in a partial or broken state (exactly when users need the installer to just work).  The portable MinGit approach sidesteps winget, the Windows installer registry, and any existing system Git entirely.  If the Linket Git install itself ever breaks, `Remove-Item %LOCALAPPDATA%\linket\git` and re-run the installer — no system impact, no uninstall drama.

The installer also sets `HERMES_GIT_BASH_PATH` to the located `bash.exe` so Linket resolves it deterministically in fresh shells.

If you prefer WSL2, the Linux installer above works inside it; both native and WSL installs can coexist without conflict (native data lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\linket`, WSL data lives under `~/.linket`).

### Android / Termux

Linket now ships a Termux-aware installer path too:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertbr123/Linket-Agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The installer detects Termux automatically and switches to a tested Android flow:
- uses Termux `pkg` for system dependencies (`git`, `python`, `nodejs`, `ripgrep`, `ffmpeg`, build tools)
- creates the virtualenv with `python -m venv`
- exports `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` automatically for Android wheel builds
- installs a curated `.[termux]` extra with `pip`
- skips the untested browser / WhatsApp bootstrap by default

If you want the fully explicit path, follow the dedicated [Termux guide](./termux.md).

:::note Windows Feature Parity (Early Beta)

Native Windows is in **early beta**. Everything except the browser-based dashboard chat terminal runs natively on Windows:
- **CLI (`linket chat`, `linket setup`, `linket gateway`, …)** — native, uses your default terminal
- **Gateway (Telegram, Discord, Slack, …)** — native, runs as a background PowerShell process
- **Cron scheduler** — native
- **Browser tool** — native (Chromium via Node.js)
- **MCP servers** — native (stdio and HTTP transports both supported)
- **Dashboard `/chat` terminal pane** — **WSL2 only** (uses a POSIX PTY; native Windows has no equivalent).  The rest of the dashboard (sessions, jobs, metrics) works natively — only the embedded PTY terminal tab is gated.

Set `HERMES_DISABLE_WINDOWS_UTF8=1` in your environment if you hit an encoding-related bug and want to fall back to the legacy cp1252 stdio path (useful for bisecting).

### What the Installer Does

The installer handles everything automatically — all dependencies (Python, Node.js, ripgrep, ffmpeg), the repo clone, virtual environment, global `linket` command setup, and LLM provider configuration. By the end, you're ready to chat.

#### Install Layout

Where the installer puts things depends on whether you're installing as a normal user or as root:

| Installer | Code lives at | `linket` binary | Data directory |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per-user (normal) | `~/.linket/linket-agent/` | `~/.local/bin/linket` (symlink) | `~/.linket/` |
| Root-mode (`sudo curl … \| sudo bash`) | `/usr/local/lib/linket-agent/` | `/usr/local/bin/linket` | `/root/.linket/` (or `$HERMES_HOME`) |

The root-mode **FHS layout** (`/usr/local/lib/…`, `/usr/local/bin/linket`) matches where other system-wide developer tools land on Linux. It's useful for shared-machine deployments where one system install should serve every user. Per-user config (auth, skills, sessions) still lives under each user's `~/.linket/` or explicit `HERMES_HOME`.

### After Installation

Reload your shell and start chatting:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or: source ~/.zshrc
linket             # Start chatting!
```

To reconfigure individual settings later, use the dedicated commands:

```bash
linket model          # Choose your LLM provider and model
linket tools          # Configure which tools are enabled
linket gateway setup  # Set up messaging platforms
linket config set     # Set individual config values
linket setup          # Or run the full setup wizard to configure everything at once
```

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is **Git**. The installer automatically handles everything else:

- **uv** (fast Python package manager)
- **Python 3.11** (via uv, no sudo needed)
- **Node.js v22** (for browser automation and WhatsApp bridge)
- **ripgrep** (fast file search)
- **ffmpeg** (audio format conversion for TTS)

:::info
You do **not** need to install Python, Node.js, ripgrep, or ffmpeg manually. The installer detects what's missing and installs it for you. Just make sure `git` is available (`git --version`).
:::

:::tip Nix users
If you use Nix (on NixOS, macOS, or Linux), there's a dedicated setup path with a Nix flake, declarative NixOS module, and optional container mode. See the **[Nix & NixOS Setup](./nix-setup.md)** guide.

## Manual / Developer Installation

If you want to clone the repo and install from source — for contributing, running from a specific branch, or having full control over the virtual environment — see the [Development Setup](../developer-guide/contributing.md#development-setup) section in the Contributing guide.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `linket: command not found` | Reload your shell (`source ~/.bashrc`) or check PATH |
| `API key not set` | Run `linket model` to configure your provider, or `linket config set OPENROUTER_API_KEY your_key` |
| Missing config after update | Run `linket config check` then `linket config migrate` |

For more diagnostics, run `linket doctor` — it will tell you exactly what's missing and how to fix it.
